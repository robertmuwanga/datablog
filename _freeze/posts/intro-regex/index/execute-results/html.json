A single line of code implementing a regex pattern can save several lines of code, keeping the overall codebase concise and easily maintainable.\n\n## So what does it do?\n\nIt uses pattern matching to find...\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFocusing on cleaning one's data set into a tidy dataset helps to set one up for success, making it easier to use functions that comply with the tidy principles in one's analysis. It may take a bit of work to get it right but once its done appropriately, it is quite powerful.\n",
