    "text": "A Simple Example\nLet’s take an example of how we might intuitively look at a dataset to determine if its “tidy-ness”. Consider the following hypothetical table that is tracking student records at a local school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nStudentID\nAge_and_Sex\nScience_Score\nMath_Score\nEnglish_Score\n\n\n\n\nRobert\nS001\n18 M\n90\n95\n70\n\n\nJohn\nS002\n15 M\n88\n79\n60\n\n\nJane\nS003\n17 F\n50\n50\n55\n\n\nAbdul\nS004\n14 M\n70\n90\n100\n\n\nTracy\nS005\n16 F\n40\n100\n90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you notice? Based off the rules that we have, we have a couple of violations. Let’s reflect this against the Tidy Principles:\n1. Each column is a variable.\nAlthough each column could be considered a variable, the context is wanting. Although Name and StudentID satisfy this rule, we can clearly see that the “Age_and_Sex” variables seems to represent two variables fused as one (Age and Sex).\nAlso notice the variables for each subject score - Science_Score, Math_Score and English_Score. These variable names seem not to be variables but rather values masked as variables - Science, Math and English. In essence, these values should be put under a new variable with an appropriate variable name (e.g. Subject) and the values - the scores - put within a second variable with an appropriate variable name (e.g. Score).\n2. Each row is an observation.\nAlthough each row in essence is an observation, the placement of the values would need to change given the above rule violations. Implementing the above changes would reduce the “length” of each observation - the number of variables captured per observation would reduce from 6 per observation to just 4 (Name, StudentID, Subject, and Score).\n3. Each cell (intersection between the column and row) is a SINGLE value.\nIt was evident that the “Age_And_Sex” column had two values instead of just a single value.\nGiven the above principle violations, the “untidy” data would probably be best structured as follows in order satisfying each of the three Tidy Principles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nStudentID\nAge\nSex\nSubject\nScore\n\n\n\n\nRobert\nS001\n18\nM\nScience\n90\n\n\nRobert\nS001\n18\nM\nMath\n95\n\n\nRobert\nS001\n18\nM\nEnglish\n70\n\n\nJohn\nS002\n15\nM\nScience\n88\n\n\nJohn\nS002\n15\nM\nMath\n79\n\n\nJohn\nS002\n15\nM\nEnglish\n60\n\n\nJane\nS003\n17\nF\nScience\n50\n\n\nJane\nS003\n17\nF\nMath\n50\n\n\nJane\nS003\n17\nF\nEnglish\n55\n\n\nAbdul\nS004\n14\nM\nScience\n70\n\n\nAbdul\nS004\n14\nM\nMath\n90\n\n\nAbdul\nS004\n14\nM\nEnglish\n100\n\n\nTracy\nS005\n16\nF\nScience\n40\n\n\nTracy\nS005\n16\nF\nMath\n100\n\n\nTracy\nS005\n16\nF\nEnglish\n90"

    "title": "How can OKRs Support Innovation Creation and Discovery?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A lot has been talked about when it comes to Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Some see it as the “holy grail” to improving organisational performance, whilst others see it as “just another performance management tool”. But, as a mental model, it works well in driving daily performance expectations, projects, and innovation discovery and creation.\nSo, how can OKRs support innovation? Let’s first understand briefly what OKRs are all about.\nOKRs can be seen as a performance management tool, but one that focuses on goals as a means to help guide an organisation, team or individual align towards delivering measurable and impactful outcomes. As one would notice, the words in bold are those typically used as pillars of innovative teams and activities.\n\nObjectives state a concrete, action-oriented and inspirational desired state, whilst Key Results help define specific, time bound, aggressive but realistic, measurable and verifiable targets.\n\nLet’s put it into context.\nAs a typical example, consider a company that is embarking on making its way of doing business sustainable and environmentally friendly. As a consultancy company, it has recognised that its carbon footprint is quite high compared to other companies in its industry.\nIt therefore creates a set of OKRs that can help the organisation start its journey towards this goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective\nCreate the lowest carbon footprint in the consultancy industry\n\n\n\n\nKey Result 1\nReduce the use of paper printing in its report development process by 90%.\n\n\nKey Result 2\nReduce the company’s energy use by 50%.\n\n\nKey Result 3\nUse 100% reusable or recyclable material for all client events.\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the Objective is concrete, action-oriented and inspirational, whilst its accompanying Key Results are specific and aggressive, but are measurable and verifiable. We can assume for this example that these are for the entire year (time bound).\nHow about innovation?\nNot all organisations are the same when it comes to managing innovation. In my opinion, innovation should be part of how organisations do work as opposed to a “plug-in” where it comes in after the fact. Innovation should be embedded implicitly in the way organisations set out their strategy and goals, but rewarded explicitly to help drive the creative culture an organisation strives to have. A culture of innovation expedites the speed of an organisation in meeting its strategic goals and allows for new challenges to quickly come on-board.\nAs an example, let’s assume a Fintech is looking at adding Investments as a product line and sees building a savings culture with its customers as a potential strategy to increase its liquidity for investing. It therefore has “making savings a way of life” as a company-wide objective and identifies 3 key results that will define its success:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective\nMake savings a way of life for its customers\n\n\n\n\nKey Result 1\nMake its saving product the best performing product within 2 years in its portfolio.\n\n\nKey Result 2\nMake enrolment and use of the product as seamless as possible.\n\n\nKey Result 3\nAt least 40% of its customer base should be enrolled onto the product by the end of the financial year.\n\n\n\nThe company’s product and technology teams for this company decide to pick up on this new objective and create new team objectives that feed into Key Results 1 and 2 respectively.\nThe product team may leverage on its design thinking approach to craft a set of key results that can enable the team identify a potentially new product for the company:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective\nCreate a saving product that is the best offering in the company’s portfolio\n\n\n\n\nKey Result 1\nTalk to 80 new and 50 existing customers by the end of January.\n\n\nKey Result 2\nPropose (at most) 3 pain points that could be solved by savings by the end of January.\n\n\nKey Result 3\nTest at least one high-fidelity potential prototype with at least 80 customers by the end of March.\n\n\nKey Result 4\nPresent a viable product for scaling by 15 April.\n\n\n\nThe technology team for this company may craft OKRs aligned to the Key Result 2 as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective\nBuild technology that enables a seamless customer saving experience by end of Q4\n\n\n\n\nKey Result 1\nLaunch mobile app by by end of Q3.\n\n\nKey Result 2\nEnable real-time reporting on product adoption and usage by Q3.\n\n\nKey Result 3\nScale infrastructure to support 1,000,000 customers by the end of Q4.\n\n\nKey Result 4\nEnsure 100% compliance to GDPR and related data protection laws.\n\n\n\nThese Key Results may be further broken down by teams within the technology department that may be in charge of software development, infrastructure support, information security and others.\nThis is where the alignment of OKRs come into fruition - a pyramid of objectives and key results can be created across teams, each feeding into the other to ensure alignment to the overall strategic goal.\nOKRs define success and set “what” needs to be accomplished, not “how” it should be accomplished. This allows for teams to create initiatives that can meet the aggressive key results, the beauty being that teams will need to think differently and out-of-the-box to create really innovative solutions that can rise to these hard targets.\nIf implemented well, OKRs could be the answer to many organisations looking to embed innovation as part of its culture. The only thing that remains is creating an ecosystem of knowledge and partners, and a recognition and rewards system that can empower, inspire and allow staff to try, fail, learn and innovate to their best!"
